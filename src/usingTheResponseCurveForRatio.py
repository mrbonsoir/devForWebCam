Let say you have measured a response curve. This means that for some 
known digital input [0,255] you have the corresponding digital value.

Let say you have measured digital values for each color channel that gives
the equivalence in intensity for a reference gray level versus a basis level
plus one of the color channel in addition. You still want to have the real 
digital value according to the response curve.
